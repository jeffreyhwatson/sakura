A simple linear regression model was created with `Full-flowering date (DOY)` as the target and `F` (Mean Temp in Kyoto for March) as the predictor. R-squared and the correlation coefficient for the fahrenheit temperature feature were found and the data and model were checked for adherence to the assumptions of linear reggression.

## Regression Formula

`D = 189.14 -1.97T`

Where D is the Peak Bloom Day and T is the average temperature for March in Kyoto for the year.

## Interpretation

Our intercept suggests that if the average March temperature in Kyoto is 0 degrees fahrenheit, the mean peak bloom day will occur on the 189th day of the year. The fahrenheit (F) coefficient indicates that for every 1 degree rise in mean March temperature, on average the peak bloom day will occur 1.96 days earlier. Lastly, r-squared of .146 says that around 14% of the variance in peak bloom dates can be accounted for through the mean March temperature in Kyoto.

## Linear Regression Assumptions

The model and data were found to be mostly inline with the assumptions of linear regression. The only assumption broken was the homoscadasticity of the residuals.
